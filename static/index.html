	<p style = "margin-left: 25px;"><b>Haley Kong </b> is a Junior at Stanford University and is currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction. She is a student by day but a Taekwondo athlete by night.  She likes fighting people (only during Taekwondo matches) and likes to say that her inspiration for starting a martial art was the Pink Power Ranger and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  In addition to training, Haley likes collecting penny presses, gardening, baking, and playing with her dog, who is fondly known as Mundungus.  John Hennessy is the president of Stanford University.  He takes HCI classes in his spare time.</p>
